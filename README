GopherMD, a little tool for the analysis of MD trajectories.


This program makes extensive use of the goChem Computational Chemistry library.
If you use this program, we kindly ask you support it by to citing the library as:

R. Mera-Adasme, G. Savasci and J. Pesonen, "goChem, a library for computational chemistry", http://www.gochem.org.

The gonum library (http://www.gonum.org/) is also much used (and appreciated).



Gopher MD obtains different parameters for each frame of a trajectory, depending on the task selected, and prints it stdout to be plot against the frame number.

Compilation:
Gopher MD works with the current development version of goChem. It also requires the silly chemical utils (github.com/rmera/scu) and the xdrfile library from Gromacs (www.gromacs.com).

Binaries for common architectures are likely available upon requests.

*Use:
program [-skip=X -begin=Y] Task pdbname xtcname task_specific_arguments

Where X and Y are positive intergers.


**Tasks

Gopher MD can perform several tasks, and it is build so the implementation of new tasks is rather simple. The current tasks and their flags are:


***Ramachandran:
	./gomd  [-skip=X -begin=Y] Ramachandran pdbname xtcname "residuename1 chain1" "residuename2 chain2" ... "residuenameN chainN" [RGB total_frames]

	Will plot the phi and psi angles for each residue/chain pair given on each frame on the trajectory. If the RGB keyword and the number of total frames that will be read from the trajectory are given, in addition to the phi/psi pair, three more columns will be printed for each residue/chain pair: The RGB numbers for a color (0 to 255) which will progress from red to purple (the standard hue circle) with increasing frames. This is useful to plot each phi/psi with its own color and follow the proggression of them with the trajectory. A little tool for plotting these results on Gnuplot is included which supports up to four different residues. 

***RMSD: Plots the RMSD of the given selections against the coordinates in the reference PDB file for those selections.
	
	./gomd [-skip=X -begin=Y] RMSD pdbname xtcname "selection1" "selection2" ... "selectionN"

***ClosestN: Given a selection, plots the distances for the closest N of an also given list of residue names to the selection, for each frame.

	./gomd [-skip=X -begin=Y] ClosestN pdbname xtcname "selection" "residuename1 residuename2 residuenameM" N [--COM]

	Where N is a positive integer. Residue names are given in 3 letter format (ASP, HIS, etc). The name for the water molecules will vary with the force-field used (SOL, HOH, WAT, etc). Distances of a residue with itself will not be considered. If --COM is given, the center of mass of the residues will be used.   

***Distance: Plots the distance between pairs of selections for each frame of the trajectory. 

	./gomd [-skip=X -begin=Y] Distance pdbname xtcname "selection1" "selection2" ... "selectionN" 
	
	Where N is an even number. The distances between selections 1 and 2, ... N-1 and N for each frame will be printed to stdout. If a selection has more than one atom, the center of mass for that selection is used.
